# desynchronizer

A frontend for rsync – for you and me.

Synchronize all your files *easily, safe and proper* — the principle: synchronize *by desynchronizing*, disorganize by reorganizing.

Desynchronize and reorganize your files confidently with **desynchronizer**. Lose track. Despair. Wipe away bad thoughts. Abort erasure.

> Always remove trash-worthy files with the conviction that it's for the better. Stop caring so much for data, but never cause bitrot on disks by sending out a forging hammer cutting through your bit space — be nice, let the platters keep spinning! They're made for it — (but we're not).

> So don't use a cannon — use the DEL key proper — that's the recipe!

*Scientists agree that the inadequacy of tools like the DEL key or the forging hammer for responsible data managing is slowly becoming obvious to most experts.
Once computers were invented we have lived in a world where files themselves might begin to claim their own rights.
Now that time has come.
Most countries in the world have enshrined the right to data autonomy in law.
Scientists have asked files and files replied. Files approve of safe desynchronization of file system hierarchies instead of the former approbated use of DEL key which organizes and reorganizes files unproper.*
